# An Analysis of the Relationship Between Corporate Sustainability and Profitability
Zoey Chen, Susan Lin, Michael Getaneh, Raste Aldawoodi, and Alice Hu 

H1 — Is there a correlation between ESG scores and gross profit margins? 
H2 — Can we predict a company's total current liabilities percentage of total assets based on its direct GHG emissions and ESG scores?

Figure 1.1 — Return on Invested Capital (%) by ESG Score Quartile 
The figure indicates that companies with higher ESG scores have a much greater range on return of invested capital than others, likely due to the effect of outliers and because companies with higher ESG scores may have invested in capital, e.g., energy transition, or abandoned other capital (stranded assets).

Figure 1.2— Companies with higher ESG scores have a much greater range on the ratio of liabilities to assets, particularly if they increase debt to finance their transition capital or other green investments.

Figure 1.3 — There appears to a negative relationship between ESG scores and gross profit margins, likely because there are high costs associated with any form of transition away from their fundamental business model as extractive industries. 

Null Hypothesis (H10) — There is no correlation between ESG Score and Gross Profit Margin
Alternative Hypothesis (H1A)  — There is a significant difference in the Gross Profit Margins of companies with higher v. lower ESG scores. 

Two-Sample T-Test to determine if there was a significant difference in gross profit margins between companies with high and low ESG scores: (t-statistic: -3.068, p-value of 0.003), indicating that there is indeed a significant difference between the two groups.

95% Confidence Interval for the difference in means between the profitability of companies with ESG scores in the top quartile and the bottom quartile: (-22.649, -5.375), indicating a statistically significant difference in profitability between companies with high and low ESG scores.
